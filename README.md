## Project Vision Statement
**User Stories**
- As a college student living in a dorm, I want to know how to cook, so that I can save money.
- As a busy worker, I want to cook simple meals, so that I can save time cooking and focus on my work. 
- As a parent with a daughter with high standards with her food, I want to know what to cook every day, so that I donâ€™t have to be stressed about picking what to cook. 

**Minimum Viable Product**  
The Minimum Viable Product of Recipe Grandma is the automatic recipe recommendation tool according to the ingredients input of the users. Based on the collected recipes in the internal database, users will be able to choose from the recommended recipes. 

After finalizing the Minimum Viable Product, our team aims to implement Computer Vision techniques to allow scanning ingredients, instead of manually inserting ingredients into the App. Furthermore, to further improve the user-interaction in the App, 'Reviews' page for each recipe will be added for users to share their comments with each other.

## Project History
This project came to be due to a recognized need amongst the group to be able to quickly assess food options available. It was realized that the inconvenience of figuring out the food items available from raw ingredients proves difficult for daily life for the average person. This compels them to eat out, lower the quality of the food they eat, or not eat at all. This app aims to solve this mutual dilemma we've all faced with a better user experience offered by competitors.

Each team will decide, using whatever decision-making process they prefer, on which two members will fill the initial roles of **Scrum Master** and **Product Owner**.

- all team members, including Scrum Master and Product Owner, are also **Developers** - everyone is expected to do the design and code work in every sprint.
- these roles must shift every Sprint, so each team member should fill each role at least once.
- each team must announce which team members are **Scrum Master** and **Product Owner** at the start of each Sprint
