## Project History
This project came to be due to a recognized need amongst the group to be able to quickly assess food options available. It was realized that the inconvenience of figuring out the food items available from raw ingredients proves difficult for daily life for the average person. This compels them to eat out, lower the quality of the food they eat, or not eat at all. This app aims to solve this mutual dilemma we've all faced with a better user experience offered by competitors. Please look at [how to contribute](https://github.com/agiledev-students-fall2022/final-project-team-recipe-grandma/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Building the Project
1. Fork the project with your own branch.
2. Run `npm install` in the back-end and front-end directories.
3. Set up a mongodb account and follow the back-end instructions to set up your database.
4. Run `npm flow` on the front-end to confirm there are no errors.
5. Run `npm run start` on both the back-end and front-end in separate terminal processes.
6. Happy developing!

## Testing the Project


## Project roles

| Week | Scrum Master | Product Owner | Developers |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| Week 0 |Geon Tack|Yeonie|Jennifer, Mohammed, Oyungerel, Nghia|

Each team will decide, using whatever decision-making process they prefer, on which two members will fill the initial roles of **Scrum Master** and **Product Owner**.

- all team members, including Scrum Master and Product Owner, are also **Developers** - everyone is expected to do the design and code work in every sprint.
- these roles must shift every Sprint, so each team member should fill each role at least once.
- each team must announce which team members are **Scrum Master** and **Product Owner** at the start of each Sprint
